<h3>Facts About Crocheting</h3>
<p1>Here are some facts about crocheting that I though were kinda Intresting:</p1>
<ol>
	<li>Crochet helped pull the Irish out of the depths of the devastating potato famine (1845–1850). A group of Ursuline nuns taught local women thread crochet, which became known as "Irish Crochet." It became incredibly popular and provided much-needed income.</li>
	<li>Over 2,000 women from 14 countries met in India to create the world's largest crocheted blanket. The mega-blanket measured approximately 120,000 square feet, or about the size of one-and-a-half football fields.</li>
	<li>Crocheting has been proven to help with insomnia, stress, anxiety, and depression.</li>
	<li>Crocheting can reduce the risk of Alzheimer's by 30–50%.</li>
